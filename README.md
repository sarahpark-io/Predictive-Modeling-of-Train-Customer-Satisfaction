# Predictive Modeling of Bullet Train Customer Satisfaction

## Description

This project involves using ensemble learning classification techniques to identify important features and predict customer satisfaction.

1. **Data Preprocessing:** Identified and addressed missing values, and determined which variables to drop.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzed summary statistics and distributions to understand the dataset better.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Performed feature engineering to enhance model performance.
4. **Label Encoding:** Used LabelEncoder to convert categorical labels into numerical format.
5. **Imputation:** Compared different imputation techniques (SimpleImputer, KNNImputer, mean, and median) to handle missing data.
6. **Model Training and Testing:**
- Random Forest: Trained and tested the model using Random Forest classifier.
- XGBooster: Implemented and evaluated an additional ensemble learning method, XGBooster classification.
8. **Model Evaluation:** Compared model performance using accuracy scores obtained from accuracy_score in sklearn.metrics.
9. **Feature Importance:** Created a feature importance chart using XGBoost to understand the impact of each feature.
10. **Final Output:** Exported a CSV file containing IDs and predicted customer satisfaction scores.
